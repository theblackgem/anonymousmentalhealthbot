# anonymousmentalhealthbot
This is a discord bot ran in discord.py. This allows users to use this bot to confess their emotions to allow people to help them. This will send a message to them in DMs, post their message in the specified channel, and keep it completely anonymous to anyone on the server. Only the person who runs this bot can see who sent the messages (in order to protect them in a life or death situation, you'd need to know)
